# Monitoring and Analysis

This section covers real-time monitoring and analysis of your AI agent's performance using Azure AI Evaluation.

## Real-time Monitoring
- Performance tracking
- Resource utilization
- Error detection
- Alert configuration
- Response timing
- Usage patterns

## Analysis Tools
- Performance dashboards
- Metric visualization
- Trend analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Resource optimization
- Cost analysis

## Interactive Workshop

To get hands-on experience with monitoring and analysis, we've prepared an interactive Jupyter notebook that will guide you through:
- Setting up real-time monitoring
- Configuring alerts and notifications
- Analyzing performance trends
- Creating dashboards
- Implementing continuous improvement

[Launch Monitoring Workshop](../building_agent/monitoring_analysis/monitoring_analysis.ipynb)

This notebook provides a practical implementation of monitoring and analysis tools. You'll work directly with the Azure AI Evaluation SDK to track and optimize your customer service agent's performance in real-time.
