## Interactive Workshop

To get hands-on experience with Azure AI Evaluation, we've prepared an interactive Jupyter notebook that will guide you through:
- Setting up evaluation metrics
- Running evaluations on your health advisor agent
- Analyzing and interpreting results with safety checks
- Implementing best practices for evaluation

[Launch Interactive Evaluation Workshop](../2-notebooks/3-quality_attributes/2-evaluation.ipynb)

This notebook provides a practical implementation of the concepts covered in this introduction. You'll work directly with the Azure AI Evaluation SDK to assess and improve your health advisor agent's performance and safety measures.
