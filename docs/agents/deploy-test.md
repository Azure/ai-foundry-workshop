# Deploying and Testing Agents

Learn how to effectively deploy, test, and maintain AI agents in Azure AI Foundry.

## Deployment Planning

### 1. Environment Preparation
- Resource allocation
- Network configuration
- Security setup
- Monitoring tools
- Backup systems
- Recovery procedures

### 2. Deployment Strategy
- Deployment methods
- Version control
- Rollback plans
- Scaling strategy
- Performance targets
- Security measures

### 3. Configuration Management
- Environment variables
- Service connections
- Authentication setup
- Authorization rules
- Logging configuration
- Monitoring settings

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-deployment Tasks
