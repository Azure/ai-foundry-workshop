# Introduction to AI Agents

Learn about AI agents in Azure AI Foundry and how they can enhance your applications with intelligent, autonomous capabilities.

## Understanding AI Agents

### What are AI Agents?

AI agents are intelligent software components that can:
- Process and understand information
- Make autonomous decisions
- Execute actions independently
- Learn from interactions and feedback
- Integrate with various services
- Handle complex workflows

### Core Capabilities

1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Understanding user inputs
   - Generating human-like responses
   - Context awareness
   - Multi-language support

2. **Decision Making**
   - Rule-based logic
   - Machine learning models
   - Pattern recognition
   - Adaptive responses

3. **Task Automation**
   - Workflow automation
   - Process orchestration
   - Error handling
   - Status reporting

## Types of Agents

### 1. Task-Specific Agents
- Focused on single domains
- Optimized performance
- Specialized knowledge
- Clear success metrics
- Efficient resource usage

### 2. Multi-Purpose Agents
- Handle various tasks
- Context switching
- Adaptive behavior
- Broad knowledge base
- Flexible deployment

### 3. Collaborative Agents
- Team coordination
- Information sharing
- Task distribution
- Resource optimization
- Synchronized actions

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- Language models
- Decision engines
- Memory systems
- Integration interfaces
- Monitoring systems

### 2. Integration Points
- External services
- Data sources
- User interfaces
- Security systems
